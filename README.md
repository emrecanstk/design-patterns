# Desing Patterns
In software engineering, a design pattern is a general repeatable solution to a commonly occurring problem in software design. A design pattern isn't a finished design that can be transformed directly into code. It is a description or template for how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations.

## Creational Design Patterns 
Creational design patterns provide various object creation mechanisms, which increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.

* *Singleton pattern restricts the instantiation of a class and ensures that only one instance of the class exists in the java virtual machine.*
* *The factory design pattern is used when we have a superclass with multiple sub-classes and based on input, we need to return one of the sub-class. This pattern takes out the responsibility of the instantiation of a class from the client program to the factory class.*
