/*
 * It would be easy to understand prototype design pattern with an example. Suppose we have an Object that loads data from database.
 * Now we need to modify this data in our program multiple times, so itâ€™s not a good idea to create the Object using new keyword and load all the data again from database.
 * The better approach would be to clone the existing object into a new object and then do the data manipulation. Prototype design pattern mandates that the Object which you are copying should provide the copying feature.
 * It should not be done by any other class. However whether to use shallow or deep copy of the Object properties depends on the requirements and its a design decision.
